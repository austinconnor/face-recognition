# face-recognition
Facial Recognition in Python!

To train on your own face, run `train.py`.  
This will open up a webcam display. Make sure this window is selected, then press SPACE to take your picture.  
That's it! Your face will now be detectable.

Now you can run `run.py`. Console outputs will be displayed with who was detected and where.
